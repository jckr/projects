						#text In 2000, irrigation was by far the largest use of water, representing over 2 thirds of the water demand. But by 2050, the amount of water used for irrigation will decrease slightly. Irrigation will only account for less than 40% of demand, while manufacturing water demand will be multiplied by 5.
